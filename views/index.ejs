            <p>QUOTES - A quotation is the repetition of a sentence, phrase, or passage from speech or text that someone has said or written. And to us quotes are one of the highest compliments we can pay an author :) As the saying goes: "You will die but
                the words you spoke will forever live."</p>
            <p>We at Quoti believe that a daily dose of inspiration can make a great turn of your day and even how you see your life entirly! We all can sometimes feel dicouraged doing the things we do routinely and thus a dash of goodness in your day may
                fuel you to get past what you're dealing with =]
